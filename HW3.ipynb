    "a) Just by pure miscategorization, the first algorithm had 8 out of 100 photos, whereas the second had 12 out of 101 photos. In total, the first algorithm had a 8% error while the second had ~12% error, so the first algorithm made the fewest mistakes.\n",

    "b) In this specific situation, because we don't really care for false bird identification, we will focus on false person identification. For NN, 5 out of 50 bird identifications failed, resulting in 10% error. For NA, 11 out of 58 bird identifications failed, resulting ~19% error. Hence, the NA algorithm is better for the zoo.\n",

    "a) For the sum of two identical exponential distributions $X_1$ and $X_2$ with identical $λ$ parameter, then the PDF of $Z = X_1 + X_2$ is $f_Z (z) = λ^2 ze^{-λz}$, which is an Erlang distribution.\n",
